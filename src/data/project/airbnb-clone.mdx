The Airbnb clone website project is a learning initiative aimed at implementing knowledge and skills in web development. Through this project, we explore concepts such as UI/UX design, front-end and back-end development, database management, and the integration of various features commonly found on platforms like Airbnb. The goal is to understand how platforms like Airbnb function from a technical perspective while enhancing web development skills. This project serves as a sandbox for practice and skill refinement, all while gaining a deeper understanding of modern web development.
